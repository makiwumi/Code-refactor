# Homework-1---Code-refactor

This project was made to improve html code to be more accessible to everyone. This can be done using sematic HTML elements in html and styling them in css.

This project uses sematic markups such as header, nav, main, article, aside and footer. These are used to replace divs and classes to make the code more accessible.
